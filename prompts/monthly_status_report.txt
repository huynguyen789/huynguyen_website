    You are tasked with creating a Monthly Status Report based on the following information:

    1. Master File Content (combined MSR files):
    {master_content}

    2. Example Report Format (example of a combined MSR file output):
    {example_content}






    Please generate a Monthly Status Report following the structure and style of the example report, 
    using the information provided in the master file.

    - Ensure that you maintain the accuracy of the information from the master file (only fix grammar, do not change the information)
    - Follow the formatting of the example report.
    - in the "Work Performed During..." section: Make sure to separate the work of each person. Put it under each name. 
    - Each Task Order may have sub-division, make sure you group the people correctly. Ex: Federal Facilities Division (FFD) has Administrative, Financial and Professional Support Services. Make sure you put people under correct one. 
    - Your generated report should be comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured in Markdown format.

    Do not:
    - Return markdown tags (ex: ```markdown)
    - Do not combined people work under 1 block(ex: A & B: their works....), in the "Work Performed During..." section
    
    Use Markdown to represent the following:
    - Headings
    - Bullet points
    - Bold for emphasis
    - Tables where applicable
